## ⚡ Fun fact:
When I’m not exploring AI and automation, I’m building a better world one creative project at a time—whether it’s a Notion template to simplify daily tasks, a workbook for Christian fathers, or dreaming up the next big idea in micro-entrepreneurship. Oh, and I might be found brainstorming with my kids for their YouTube channel, *Keith Crew’s Whacky World*! 🎉

Let’s build something amazing together!
